# FlightSimulator
Simple project evolving from https://github.com/dcyoung/TerrainGenerator
Uses WebGL to create a very basic flight simulator.
Controls: 
-WASD for pitch/roll 
-mouse for pitch/roll (to use the mouse, you have to click inside the canvas and then wait a few seconds for any popups)
-"Q and E" keys for throttle down and up

The code is well commented/self-explanatory.
